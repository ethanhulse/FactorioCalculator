# FactorioCalculator


## The Gist
- This is a project of mine that was created to fill the need for a good rate calculator/mod that can accurately plan out the flow of a factory with the ability to add custom
recipes as well as modded items in a readable and modular manner. 
 - As of writing this, only a rough draft has been completed but the basics are in place. Feel free to 
reach out to me if you find any issues or wish to contribute to the project.
